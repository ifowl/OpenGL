# Animation
### Description
After building upon the joint manipulation in the last project, I was able to implement animation cycles using glutTimerFunc. I have made line and circle walking paths
with walk animation and additionally added a jumping in place animation loop. The camera movement is also now done with the left and right mouse buttons.
