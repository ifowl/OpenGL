# Textures and Viewports
### Description
Finally, I managed to make a fluid animation using trees and textures. Textures are updated depending on the model chosen, and can be further altered using the menu.
The walking speed of the character can be changed as well. Additionally, I included a second viewport with its own camera that can toggled on and off and moved around
the scene using the mouse and arrow keys.
